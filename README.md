Data Acquisition &amp; Wrangling
1.	Data Acquisition & Wrangling: This involves obtaining raw data from various sources and then cleaning, restructuring, and preparing it for analysis. It encompasses tasks like handling missing values, dropping irrelevant data, and merging datasets.
2.	Missing Values: Identifying and handling missing values is crucial for data analysis. Techniques include imputation (filling missing values with estimated ones) or removing rows/columns with missing values.
3.	Data Drop: Dropping data refers to removing rows or columns from a dataset, often to eliminate irrelevant or redundant information.
4.	Data Unique: Finding unique values in a dataset helps identify distinct categories or entities within the data.
5.	Data Types (Data Dtypes): Understanding the data types of variables in a dataset is essential for proper data manipulation and analysis.
6.	Data Merge: Merging datasets involves combining multiple datasets into one based on common attributes or keys.
7.	Data isnull: The isnull() function identifies missing values in a dataset, returning a boolean mask indicating whether each value is null.
8.	Data Describe: The describe() function provides summary statistics for numerical variables in a dataset, such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and quartiles.
9.	Data Outlier: Outliers are data points that significantly differ from other observations. Identifying and handling outliers is crucial to prevent them from skewing analysis results.
10.	Data Fill: Filling missing values in a dataset involves replacing them with specific values, such as the mean, median, or mode of the respective column.
11.	Data Astype: The astype() method is used to convert the data type of one or more columns in a DataFrame.
12.	Data Boxplot: A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of the distribution of data through quartiles.
13.	Data Mean, Mode, Median: These are measures of central tendency used to describe the central position of a set of data values.
14.	Data Sort: Sorting data arranges it in a specified order, either ascending or descending.
15.	Data Head: The head() method displays the first few rows of a DataFrame.
16.	Data Shape: The shape attribute of a DataFrame returns a tuple representing its dimensions (number of rows, number of columns).
17.	Data Replace: The replace() method is used to replace values in a DataFrame with other values.
18.	Data Correlation: Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. In pandas, the corr() method computes pairwise correlation of columns in a DataFrame.
